# Password Generator

## Description

This weeks project was to test our knowledge of the JavaScript we learned in the past week to make a functional password generator.
I learned many things from this project but my favorite was learning how to use the .push to put all the selected criteria into an empty array.

## Credits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLhwJNZK8Q: this is where I learned the .push method and how to implement it into this project.
I also used the recorded zoom lessons from the last week to help me progress through the project.

## Tests

The way I tested this project was to start by clicking the "Generate Password" button, and then answerings all the prompts to select your criteria for your password. You'll notice if you answer the password length question with an invalid response you'll be prompted with how to correct it. Finally after you select all criteria for your password you will receive your new password within the box.
